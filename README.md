# Big Data in Healthcare - Sleep Stage Classification
A project that has been done as part of Georgia Tech coursework CSE 6250 - Big Data in Healthcare. The aim of the project is to accurately predict sleep stages corresponding to an individual's sleep cycle patterns thereby expediting the process of diagnosing sleep-related disorders.
## Introduction
Sleep patterns can be an important indicator of sleep apnea, insomnia, and risk of cardiovascular disorders. It, therefore, becomes important and beneficial to categorize sleep patterns. Classifying sleep patterns manually requires expert supervision and is time-consuming, subjective and expensive. So, as a part of this project we porposed to build a multi-class classifier that accurately labels sleep patterns.
